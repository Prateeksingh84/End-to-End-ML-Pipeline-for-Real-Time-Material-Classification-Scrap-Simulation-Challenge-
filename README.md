# 🏭 Scrap Simulation Challenge – End-to-End ML Pipeline for Real-Time Material Classification

This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to classify scrap materials from image data, simulating a **real-time scrap sorting conveyor**.  
It demonstrates proficiency in **data processing, model development, deployment, and documentation**.

---

## 📌 1. Project Objective
The primary objective is to build a **robust, mini-classification pipeline** that:
- Trains on image data of different scrap materials  
- Deploys a **lightweight model** for inference  
- Simulates a **real-time scrap sorting system**
