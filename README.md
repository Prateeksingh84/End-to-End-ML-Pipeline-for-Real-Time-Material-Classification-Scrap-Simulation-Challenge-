End-to-End ML Pipeline for Real-Time Material Classification
Assignment Title: Scrap Simulation Challenge
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to classify scrap materials from image data, simulating a real-time scrap sorting conveyor. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in data processing, model development, deployment, and documentation.

1. Project Objective
The primary objective is to build a robust, mini-classification pipeline that takes image data of various materials and, after being trained, deploys a lightweight model to classify new images in a simulated real-time loop.

2. Project Deliverables & Folder Structure
The project repository is organized into a clear and logical structure as follows:

3. Dataset Used
The model was trained on a custom dataset inspired by the TrashNet dataset, consisting of at least five classes of scrap materials (e.g., cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, etc.). This dataset was chosen for its direct relevance to the problem and its clear, pre-labeled structure, which facilitates easy training.

4. Model Architecture & Training Process
Architecture
The classification model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet18 architecture. This model was chosen for its balance of performance and efficiency, making it suitable for a lightweight deployment scenario.

Training Process
Data Preprocessing: The images were preprocessed using torchvision.transforms to resize them to 224x224 pixels and normalize their pixel values.

Data Augmentation: To improve the model's robustness and prevent overfitting, data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flipping and color jitter were applied to the training data.

Transfer Learning: The model was initialized with weights pre-trained on the large ImageNet dataset. This process of transfer learning allows the model to leverage existing knowledge, leading to faster convergence and better performance on the target task with less data.

Fine-tuning: The final fully connected layer of the ResNet18 model was replaced and retrained on the custom dataset while the convolutional base was frozen.

Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix on a held-out validation set.

5. Deployment Decisions
The trained PyTorch model (.pth file) was converted to the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format. This decision was made for the following reasons:

Portability: ONNX is an open standard that allows models to be run across various platforms and hardware.

Performance: The ONNX Runtime is a high-performance inference engine that optimizes the model for faster classification, which is crucial for a real-time simulation.
